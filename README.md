## Project title: Investigate-storms-in-the-world
This project is to investigate the storms dataset for 2010 - 2015 and extract information about their differences of characteristics of each year, for example, number of unique storms in each year; number of storms per hemisphere. we will be using unix for data cleaning, data manipulation, and then use R for the visualization.

## Extract the raw data
In the pair one of this project, we will be given a raw dataset. we will download them and use Unix language to interact with the datas.

## Data Importing in R
import these data to R markdown and turn them to dataframe for furtuer manipulation and investigation.

## Packages for Data Visualization

- library("dplyr")
- library("chron")
- library("ggplot2")
- library("lubridate")
- library("maps")
- library("mapdata")
- library("geofacet")


## create some important topics for investigation ( play around with the data)
